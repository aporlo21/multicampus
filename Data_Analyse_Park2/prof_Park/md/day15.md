## kaggle - bike sharing demand 

### data fields

- season ( continuous type ) => proceed by categorization 
- holiday / weekday differances ==> bingcon Consideration 
- weather : alike 'season' data, Con type => Cate (big element)
- temp / atemp : not that much differ 
- count : regression accessment



### object : analysis & predict model Process Overview



0. data collection 

   

1. python

- visualization, dictionary, pandas, logic. sequence control, filtering, repetation construction
- contains ( lamda func, iterator, list )



2. data reputation 

- reputation tech, EDA, VED(typo visualization data anlaysis method)
- process pivot table, concat, Nan values 



3. data analysis

- create pandas, df 
- VED (data visualization), statistical analysis (relation coefficent(factor)), time series indexing 
- df slicing, df convert, filtering, melt, categorization
- stack / unstack, pivot table



4. data visualization

- seaborn, matplotlib



5. machine learning & deep learning

- neuron network => faced into Limitation => RadioFrequency, SupportVectorMachine => deep learing

zero centered : mean => 0 

' data mining' : seek for meaningful pattern from data / ' knowledge discovery process '

- related rule : seek rule and patterns based on bought items list ( p.56 - common in field )
  - p.57 bagles => potato chip in Marketing promotion
- classification
  - prediction of customer running out
    - loyal & disloyal customer saperate 
- clustering
  - object : data points
  - data points contained with various attributes
  - similar data point cluster
  - similar measured cluster distances
    - intracluster distances => data points, minimize (between clusters)
    - intercluster distances => data points, maximize 
  - market segmentation (recommadation system)
- etc( series search, regression alanyisis )

- regression analysis 
  - neural network
  - definition : countious variation's future value detecting 
  - aka Deviation Detection ( Seek for strange value )
